                    <h2>Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)</h2>
                    <p>Our IOP enables patients to continue their day-to-day regimen while simultaneously  undergoing our best possible care. Measured on a case-by-case basis, patients may live in our treatment center, in a sober living community, or at their own home.</p>
                    <p>At Beach Street Rehab, we recognize that overcoming addiction on your own may not be possible. Fortunately our treatment programs give you the path to healing/recovery. Through our intensive outpatient program, we give you the tools to manage your addiction in the most healthy way possible. To learn more, reach out to us today. </p>

                        <p>It is common for those struggling with addiction to not respond well to  residential treatment options. An intensive outpatient program may be the best alternative, as it can offer a high level of care and more accountability (removing patients from access to drugs/alcohol, enabling peers, etc.).</p>
                        <p>If the patient has a strong, supportive family and group of friends/peers, they will be able to undergo care with us, but also be able to live at home.</p>
